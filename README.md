# Intro to the Houston Startup Scene

A simple slide deck with a high-level overview of the Houston Startup Scene. Meant to be given every month or so to help grow our community. 

**Please rip off these slides and share this information!** Put your own stuff in here, put your picture in the bio slide, and give this presentation to help people learn! Maybe give a shoutout to this source or to [Lean Houston](http://www.leanhouston.org) if you feel like it, but having knowledge spread is its own reward. We didn't put all this info together for it to not be shared.


## How to give this presentation:

1. `git clone git@github.com:leanhouston/houston-startup-scene-intro.git`
2. Change `img/bio.jpg` to your photo.
3. Change text in `index.html` starting around like 60 to reflect your own info.
4. If necessary, css rules for the bio slide are in `css/bio-slide.css`


## To view speaker notes

1. Perform the steps above to make the slides your own.
2. Install Node.js (preferably the version in `.nvmrc`) and Grunt.
3. Run `npm install` to get the dependencies set up. Fight your computer until they're working, though it will probably
4. Run `grunt serve`, which by default listens on port 8000.
5. Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in a browser.
6. Hit the `s` key to reveal the notes!
